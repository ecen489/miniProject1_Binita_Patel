Ingredients

1 large egg
1 15- to 16-ounce container part-skim ricotta1 
5-ounce package baby spinach, coarsely chopped
3 large or
4 small portobello mushroom caps, gills removed (see Tip), halved and thinly sliced
1 small zucchini, quartered lengthwise and thinly sliced
1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes
1 28-ounce can diced tomatoes
3 cloves garlic, minced
Pinch of crushed red pepper (optional)
15 whole-wheat lasagna noodles (about 12 ounces), uncooked
3 cups shredded part-skim mozzarella, divided

Step 1: Combine egg, ricotta, spinach, mushrooms and zucchini in a large bowl.

Step 2: Combine crushed and diced tomatoes and their juice, garlic and crushed red pepper 
	(if using) in a medium bowl

Step 3: Generously coat a 6-quart or larger slow cooker with cooking spray. Spread 1½ cups of 
	the tomato mixture in the slow cooker. Arrange 5 noodles over the sauce, overlapping 
	them slightly and breaking into pieces to cover as much of the sauce as possible. 
	Spread half of the ricotta-vegetable mixture over the noodles and firmly pat down, 
	then spoon on 1½ cups sauce and sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella. Repeat the layering one 
	more time, starting with noodles. Top with a third layer of noodles. Evenly spread the 
	remaining tomato sauce over the noodles. Set aside the remaining 1 cup mozzarella in the refrigerator.

Step 4: Put the lid on the slow cooker and cook on High for 2 hours or on Low for 4 hours. Turn off the slow cooker, 
	sprinkle the reserved mozzarella on the lasagna, cover and let stand for 10 minutes to melt the cheese.
